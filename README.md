## Auto Driving Car Simulation

## Overview
A simulation program for grid-based autonomous vehicle driving. In addition to adding vehicles and issuing commands, users may also simulate movement with boundary limits and collision detection.

## Features
Add vehicles with distinctive names to a simulation.
-To control each car's motion, set commands for it.
-Launch the simulation and watch the cars' ultimate locations and orientations.
-Identify and report vehicle-boundary collisions.

## Requirements
Python 3.9+
pytest for running tests

## Installation
  #1 Clone the repository:
  ```
        git clone https://github.com/bsreddyb/car_simulation.git
        cd car-simulation
  ```
  Or Download the code and extract to car-simulation folder.
  #2 Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):
  
  Make sure Python is installed on your computer. To keep dependencies structured and distinct from other projects, a virtual environment is advised.
  ```
          # Create a virtual environment (optional)
          python -m venv venv
          # Activate the virtual environment
          # On Windows
          venv\Scripts\activate
          # On MacOS/Linux
          source venv/bin/activate
   ```
  #3 Install the package
  
  Once you are in the virtual or global environment of your choice, you can use pip to install the car_simulation package.
  Additionally, all required dependencies will be installed:
  ```
       pip install .
  ```
##Usage

Use the following command to launch the simulation:
```
    run-simulation
```

Set up the field, add cars and launch the simulation by following the on-screen directions.

##Running Tests
To run the tests, use pytest:
    ```
        python -m pytest    
    ```

## Assumptions
- If an invalid input is entered, the application will prompt for correct inputs.
- The car's name must be distinct and required
- The name of the car must be a string with a minimum of one character.
- If a new coordinate is detected that is outside the designated field size or collides with another car, stop driving.
